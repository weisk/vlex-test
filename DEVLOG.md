# DEVLOG

# 1.
I bootstrapped a skeleton using create-react-app, with the typescript template.

Lost some time while trying to configure module paths / aliases, to be able to easily traverse paths while importing components. It's not really trivial to configure, having create-react-app, overwriting webpack config with another plugin, and the tsconfig paths...

So Moving on, keep it simple.

# 2.

I've choosen Ant Design as a UI Framework to quickly prototype beautiful ui's.
