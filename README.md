# quickstart

you should be able to quickly run this, having node installed locally, just:

clone && npm install && npm run dev

# missing features

- error messages!


# nice to haves

- a quick dockerfile to make running this even easier
- proper state management through the use of context, providers, and hooks (for the whole form state)
- work on the aesthethics of it, it's very ugly
